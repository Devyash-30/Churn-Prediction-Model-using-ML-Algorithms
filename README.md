# Churn-Prediction-Model-using-ML-Algorithms
This project presents a churn prediction model developed to anticipate the likelihood of customers leaving a service or platform. 
Through feature selection, feature engineering, and the deployment of multiple machine learning algorithms, this project offers an insightful perspective into customer behavior. 
The visualization tools used, including Power BI and matplotlib, allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the churn trends and patterns.
